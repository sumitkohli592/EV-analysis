# EV-analysis
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of Electric Vehicle (EV) charging network data to identify usage trends, optimize station performance, and support sustainable infrastructure planning. The dataset contained over 50,000 records with details such as station locations, charging durations, energy consumption, and user behavior.
